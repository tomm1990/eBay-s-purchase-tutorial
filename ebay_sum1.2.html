							<h1>2000s</h1>As the company expanded product categories beyond collectibles into almost any saleable item, business grew quickly. In February 2002, the company purchased iBazar, a similar European auction web site founded in 1998 and then bought PayPal on October 14, 2002.
							By early 2008, the company had expanded worldwide, counted hundreds of millions of registered users, 15,000+ employees and revenues of almost $7.7 billion. After nearly ten years at eBay, Whitman decided to enter politics. On January 23, 2008, the company announced that Whitman would step down on March 31, 2008 and John Donahoe was selected to become President and CEO.[20] Whitman remained on the Board of Directors and continued to advise Donahoe through 2008. In late 2009, eBay completed the sale of Skype for $2.75 billion, but will still own 30% equity in the company.<br>
							In 2012 eBay was charged with Antitrust Employment by the United States Department of Justice.<br>
							It was announced on September 30, 2014, that eBay would spinoff PayPal into a separate publicly traded company, which is taking steps that were first demanded nine months ago by activist hedge fund magnate Carl Icahn. The move will break eBay almost in half, separating it from PayPal, which eBay purchased 12 years ago and built into a giant that generates almost half of the company’s revenue. The spinoff is expected to be completed sometime in the second half of 2015. After the separation, eBay’s current chief executive, John Donahoe, will step down from that role.<br>
